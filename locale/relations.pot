msgid "phpMyAdmin allows relationships (similar to foreign keys) using MySQL-native (InnoDB) methods when available and falling back on special phpMyAdmin-only features when needed. There are two ways of editing these relations, with the *relation view* and the drag-and-drop *designer* -- both of which are explained on this page."

msgid "Currently the only MySQL table type that natively supports relationships is InnoDB. When using an InnoDB table, phpMyAdmin will create real InnoDB relations which will be enforced by MySQL no matter which application accesses the database. In the case of any other table type, phpMyAdmin enforces the relations internally and those relations are not applied to any other application."

msgid "In order to get it working, you first have to properly create the [[pmadb|pmadb]]. Once that is setup, select a table's \"Structure\" page. Below the table definition, a link called \"Relation view\" is shown. If you click that link, a page will be shown that offers you to create a link to another table for any (most) fields. Only PRIMARY KEYS are shown there, so if the field you are referring to is not shown, you most likely are doing something wrong.  The drop-down at the bottom is the field which will be used as the name for a record."
